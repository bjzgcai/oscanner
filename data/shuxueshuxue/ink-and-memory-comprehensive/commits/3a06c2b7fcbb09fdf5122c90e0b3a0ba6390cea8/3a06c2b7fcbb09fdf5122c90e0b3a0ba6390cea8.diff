----
+**Ink & Memory** is a journaling studio inspired by the inner monologues of *Disco Elysium*. As you write, a council of distinct personas chimes in—offering perspective, asking questions, or pointing out the absurdity of it all.
 
-## Core Features
+This isn't just another notes app. It's a daily writing companion that saves your work, organizes your thoughts, and helps you notice patterns in your own thinking. It speaks both English and Chinese, switching seamlessly as you write.
 
-### The Writing Experience
-At the heart of Ink & Memory is a clean, minimalist writing environment. The editor is designed to be a distraction-free space for your thoughts. As you write, the system automatically saves your work, so you never have to worry about losing a single word.
+---
 
-### The Inner Council
-As you write, a council of 16 inner voices will comment on your text, highlighting key phrases and offering their unique perspectives. These voices are inspired by a variety of archetypes, from the analytical "Unpacker" to the gentle "Holder". This feature is powered by a sophisticated AI system that analyzes your writing in real-time.
+## What Makes It Different

+  <img src="assets/writing-area.png" alt="Writing with inner voices" width="700"/>
 </p>
 
-### The Timeline and Calendar
-Every writing session is automatically saved and organized into a timeline and a calendar. This allows you to easily look back at your past entries, see your progress, and rediscover old ideas.
+**A clean writing space.** No toolbar clutter. Just a calm surface for your thoughts, with automatic saving so nothing gets lost.
 
-### Daily Image Generation
-Each day, the system automatically generates a unique image based on the content of your writing. This creates a beautiful and evocative visual representation of your thoughts and feelings over time.
+**A council of inner voices.** As you type, different personas highlight phrases and offer their takes—from the pattern-spotting Mirror to the darkly funny Absurdist. They appear as gentle watercolor highlights in the margins, never interrupting your flow.
 
-### Customizable Decks
-The 16 voices are organized into three "decks": the **Introspection Deck**, the **Scholar Deck**, and the **Philosophy Deck**. You can enable or disable decks to customize which voices are active, and you can even create your own decks with your own custom voices.
+**Your timeline, visualized.** Every session is saved to a calendar. Each day generates a unique image from your writing—a visual diary that grows with you.
 
-### Friend Timelines
-You can add friends and view their timelines alongside your own. This feature is designed to foster a sense of connection and shared experience, allowing you to see what your friends are writing and thinking about.
+**Fully customizable.** Don't like a voice? Edit it. Want new perspectives? Create your own deck. Share your creations with the community or discover what others have made.

-### Creating Your Own Voices
-
-Each voice is defined by:
-- **A system prompt** that shapes its personality and perspective
-- **An icon** for visual identification
-- **A color** that tints its highlights in your text
-
-When you fork a deck, you get full control over all these elements. Want a voice that channels your favorite philosopher? A critic that focuses on narrative structure? A cheerleader for your creative projects? Build it yourself or find it in the community store.
-
----
-
-## How the Voices Work
-
-As you write, Ink & Memory analyzes your text using a **trace-based energy system**. Here's what happens behind the scenes:
-
-1. **Energy Accumulates** — As you type, the system builds up "energy" based on your writing.
-2. **Threshold Triggers** — When enough energy accumulates, the AI analyzes your recent text.
-3. **Voices Respond** — Enabled voices scan for phrases that resonate with their personality.
-4. **Comments Appear** — Relevant voices highlight phrases and offer their perspective in the margin.
-
-This creates an organic, non-intrusive experience where comments appear naturally as you write, rather than constantly interrupting you.
-
----
-
-## Technical Architecture
-
-Ink & Memory is built on a modern stack designed for real-time AI interaction:
-
-### Frontend
-- **React 19 + TypeScript** — Type-safe, component-based UI.
-- **Vite** — Fast dev server and builds.
-- **TipTap** — Extensible rich text editing with custom extensions for voice highlights.
-- **Custom EditorEngine** — Manages editor state, comments, and chat widgets.
+| 🛡️ | **Stoic** | Emphasizes what you can and can't control |
+| 💨 | **Taoist** | Points toward effortless action and flow |
+| 🤔 | **Existentialist** | Asks about choice, freedom, meaning |
+| 👊 | **Pragmatist** | Focuses on what actually works |
 
-### Backend
-- **FastAPI + Python** — High-performance async API server.
-- **PolyCLI** — Orchestrates LLM calls with structured prompts and retry logic.
-- **Stateless Analyzer** — Core voice analysis engine that keeps context without server-side state.
-- **SQLite + WAL** — Reliable storage with concurrent read support.
+### Making Your Own
 
-### AI Integration
-- **Multi-model support** — Works with GPT-4, Claude, DeepSeek, and Gemini.
-- **Structured outputs** — Pydantic models ensure type-safe LLM responses.
-- **Daily image generation** — Automatic visual summaries of your writing.
-
-### Key Design Decisions
-- **Deck-based architecture** — Voices are organized into forkable, shareable decks.
-- **Parent-child relationships** — Forked decks can sync updates from their source.
-- **Community store** — Published decks are discoverable and installable by other users.
+Each voice is just a system prompt, an icon, and a color. Fork any deck to customize it. Create voices that channel your favorite thinker, focus on specific aspects of your life, or just make you laugh. Share them in the community store.

-## Roadmap
+## How It Works
 
-We have a lot of ideas for the future of Ink & Memory. Here are some of the things we're working on:
+The voice system uses a **trace-based energy model**:
 
-*   **More Voices and Decks:** We plan to continue expanding the library of voices and decks, offering even more perspectives on your writing.
-*   **Richer, More Immersive Experience:** We’re exploring new ways to visualize your entries, your progress, and your connections with friends.
-*   **A Platform for Creativity:** We want to make Ink & Memory a place where you can not only write, but also create, share, and collaborate with others.
-*   **Mobile App:** We're working on a mobile version of Ink & Memory, so you can write and reflect on the go.
+1. **Energy builds** as you write
+2. **Threshold triggers** analysis of recent text
+3. **Voices scan** for phrases that match their personality
+4. **Comments appear** as watercolor highlights in the margin
+
+This creates an organic rhythm—voices chime in naturally rather than constantly interrupting.

-## 声音如何工作
-
-在你写作时，Ink & Memory 使用**基于轨迹的能量系统**来分析文本。背后发生的事情是：
-
-1. **能量累积** —— 输入越多，系统获得的“能量”越高。
-2. **阈值触发** —— 能量达到阈值时，AI 会分析你刚写下的内容。
-3. **声音响应** —— 已启用的声音根据各自的个性寻找共鸣片段。
-4. **评论出现** —— 相关的声音会高亮短语，并在侧边给出观点。
-
-这让评论像自然冒出来一样，而不是频繁打断你的写作。
-
