It\u2019s a space to write, reflect, and hear your own thoughts echoed back to you through a cast of distinct inner voices. As you type, a council of archetypes chimes in, offering perspective, guidance, and a touch of the absurd.\n+<p align=\"center\">\n+  <a href=\"README.zh.md\">\u4e2d\u6587</a> \u00b7 English\n+</p>\n \n-This is more than just a notebook. It's a daily writing companion that saves your work, organizes your thoughts, and helps you discover the patterns in your own thinking. It supports both English and Chinese, adapting to your language on the fly.\n+> *Write. Reflect. Listen to the voices within.*\n \n----\n+**Ink & Memory** is a journaling studio inspired by the inner monologues of *Disco Elysium*. As you write, a council of distinct personas chimes in\u2014offering perspective, asking questions, or pointing out the absurdity of it all.\n \n-## Core Features\n+This isn't just another notes app. It's a daily writing companion that saves your work, organizes your thoughts, and helps you notice patterns in your own thinking. It speaks both English and Chinese, switching seamlessly as you write.\n \n-### The Writing Experience\n-At the heart of Ink & Memory is a clean, minimalist writing environment. The editor is designed to be a distraction-free space for your thoughts. As you write, the system automatically saves your work, so you never have to worry about losing a single word.\n+---\n \n-### The Inner Council\n-As you write, a council of 16 inner voices will comment on your text, highlighting key phrases and offering their unique perspectives. These voices are inspired by a variety of archetypes, from the analytical \"Unpacker\" to the gentle \"Holder\". This feature is powered by a sophisticated AI system that analyzes your writing in real-time.\n+## What Makes It Different\n \n <p align=\"center\">\n-  <img src=\"assets/writing-area.png\" alt=\"Ink & Memory UI\" width=\"700\"/>\n+  <img src=\"assets/writing-area.png\" alt=\"Writing with inner voices\" width=\"700\"/>\n </p>\n \n-### The Timeline and Calendar\n-Every writing session is automatically saved and organized into a timeline and a calendar. This allows you to easily look back at your past entries, see your progress, and rediscover old ideas.\n+**A clean writing space.** No toolbar clutter. Just a calm surface for your thoughts, with automatic saving so nothing gets lost.\n \n-### Daily Image Generation\n-Each day, the system automatically generates a unique image based on the content of your writing. This creates a beautiful and evocative visual representation of your thoughts and feelings over time.\n+**A council of inner voices.** As you type, different personas highlight phrases and offer their takes\u2014from the pattern-spotting Mirror to the darkly funny Absurdist. They appear as gentle watercolor highlights in the margins, never interrupting your flow.\n \n-### Customizable Decks\n-The 16 voices are organized into three \"decks\": the **Introspection Deck**, the **Scholar Deck**, and the **Philosophy Deck**. You can enable or disable decks to customize which voices are active, and you can even create your own decks with your own custom voices.\n+**Your timeline, visualized.** Every session is saved to a calendar. Each day generates a unique image from your writing\u2014a visual diary that grows with you.\n \n-### Friend Timelines\n-You can add friends and view their timelines alongside your own. This feature is designed to foster a sense of connection and shared experience, allowing you to see what your friends are writing and thinking about.\n+**Fully customizable.** Don't like a voice? Edit it. Want new perspectives? Create your own deck. Share your creations with the community or discover what others have made.\n \n ---\n \n-## Default Voice Decks\n-\n-Ink & Memory ships with three carefully crafted decks containing 16 voices to get you started. These are designed to offer different perspectives on your writing\u2014but they're just the beginning.\n+## The Voices\n \n-**You're not limited to these voices.** The deck system lets you:\n-- \ud83d\udd00 **Fork** any deck to create your own customized version\n-- \u270f\ufe0f **Edit** voice personalities, prompts, icons, and colors\n-- \u2795 **Create** entirely new voices from scratch\n-- \ud83c\udf10 **Explore** the community store for decks made by other users\n-- \ud83d\udce4 **Publish** your own decks to share with the community\n+The voices are organized into three decks.

Want a voice that channels your favorite philosopher? A critic that focuses on narrative structure? A cheerleader for your creative projects? Build it yourself or find it in the community store.\n-\n----\n-\n-## How the Voices Work\n-\n-As you write, Ink & Memory analyzes your text using a **trace-based energy system**. Here's what happens behind the scenes:\n-\n-1. **Energy Accumulates** \u2014 As you type, the system builds up \"energy\" based on your writing.\n-2. **Threshold Triggers** \u2014 When enough energy accumulates, the AI analyzes your recent text.\n-3. **Voices Respond** \u2014 Enabled voices scan for phrases that resonate with their personality.\n-4. **Comments Appear** \u2014 Relevant voices highlight phrases and offer their perspective in the margin.\n-\n-This creates an organic, non-intrusive experience where comments appear naturally as you write, rather than constantly interrupting you.\n-\n----\n-\n-## Technical Architecture\n-\n-Ink & Memory is built on a modern stack designed for real-time AI interaction:\n-\n-### Frontend\n-- **React 19 + TypeScript** \u2014 Type-safe, component-based UI.\n-- **Vite** \u2014 Fast dev server and builds.\n-- **TipTap** \u2014 Extensible rich text editing with custom extensions for voice highlights.\n-- **Custom EditorEngine** \u2014 Manages editor state, comments, and chat widgets.\n+| \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f | **Stoic** | Emphasizes what you can and can't control |\n+| \ud83d\udca8 | **Taoist** | Points toward effortless action and flow |\n+| \ud83e\udd14 | **Existentialist** | Asks about choice, freedom, meaning |\n+| \ud83d\udc4a | **Pragmatist** | Focuses on what actually works |\n \n-### Backend\n-- **FastAPI + Python** \u2014 High-performance async API server.\n-- **PolyCLI** \u2014 Orchestrates LLM calls with structured prompts and retry logic.\n-- **Stateless Analyzer** \u2014 Core voice analysis engine that keeps context without server-side state.\n-- **SQLite + WAL** \u2014 Reliable storage with concurrent read support.\n+### Making Your Own\n \n-### AI Integration\n-- **Multi-model support** \u2014 Works with GPT-4, Claude, DeepSeek, and Gemini.\n-- **Structured outputs** \u2014 Pydantic models ensure type-safe LLM responses.\n-- **Daily image generation** \u2014 Automatic visual summaries of your writing.\n-\n-### Key Design Decisions\n-- **Deck-based architecture** \u2014 Voices are organized into forkable, shareable decks.\n-- **Parent-child relationships** \u2014 Forked decks can sync updates from their source.\n-- **Community store** \u2014 Published decks are discoverable and installable by other users.\n+Each voice is just a system prompt, an icon, and a color. Fork any deck to customize it. Create voices that channel your favorite thinker, focus on specific aspects of your life, or just make you laugh. Share them in the community store.\n \n ---\n \n ## Getting Started\n \n-### Prerequisites\n-- Python 3.11+\n+### You'll Need\n+- Python 3.11+ with [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)\n - Node.js 18+\n-- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for Python package management\n \n-### Backend\n+### Backend Setup\n+\n ```bash\n cd backend\n uv venv\n-source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\\Scripts\\activate\n+source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\\Scripts\\activate\n uv pip install -r requirements.txt\n+```\n \n-# Create a models.json file for your LLM configuration\n-# The endpoint and api_key are examples, please use your own\n-cat > models.json <<'EOC'\n+Create a `models.json` file for your LLM:\n+\n+```json\n {\n   \"models\": {\n-    \"gpt-4o-dou\": {\n-      \"endpoint\": \"https://api.example.com/v1\",\n-      \"api_key\": \"your-api-key\",\n-      \"model\": \"openai/chatgpt-4o-latest\"\n+    \"default\": {\n+      \"endpoint\": \"https://api.your-provider.com/v1\",\n+      \"api_key\": \"your-key-here\",\n+      \"model\": \"gpt-4o\"\n     }\n   }\n }\n-EOC\n+```\n+\n+Then start the server:\n \n-python server.py\n+```bash\n+python server.py  # Runs on http://localhost:8765\n ```\n-The backend will be running at `http://localhost:8765`.\n \n-### Frontend\n+### Frontend Setup\n+\n ```bash\n cd frontend\n npm install\n-npm run dev\n+npm run dev  # Runs on http://localhost:5173\n ```\n-The frontend will be running at `http://localhost:5173`.\n \n ---\n \n-## Roadmap\n+## How It Works\n \n-We have a lot of ideas for the future of Ink & Memory.
