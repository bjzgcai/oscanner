      "reasoning": "The commits show basic feature implementation for voice input with WebSocket integration, but lack depth in ML model development, infrastructure automation, and testing practices. The refactoring between commits suggests iterative development, though CSS positioning changes indicate UI/UX adjustments rather than architectural improvements. No evidence of CI/CD, containerization, comprehensive testing, or advanced optimization strategies."
