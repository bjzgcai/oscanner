      "reasoning": "The commits show a mix of documentation updates, CI/CD improvements, and feature integration (voice input), but lack depth in AI/ML implementation details. While there's evidence of cloud-native practices (Docker, CI workflows) and collaboration through PRs, the majority of commits are minor documentation changes or UI refactoring. The project demonstrates basic engineering competence but limited evidence of advanced architectural decisions, comprehensive testing, or ML model optimization."
