      "reasoning": "The commits show a mix of documentation updates, CI/CD improvements, and feature integration (voice input). While there's evidence of backend ML work (speech_recognition.py, schema analysis docs), most commits are minor documentation changes or merges. The CI/CD pipeline work and smoke testing scripts demonstrate some DevOps capability, but limited evidence of architectural leadership, comprehensive testing, or optimization practices."
