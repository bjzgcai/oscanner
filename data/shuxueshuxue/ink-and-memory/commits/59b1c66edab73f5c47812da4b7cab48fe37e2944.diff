-I think we should refactor this code. The structure is a mess, and I can feel the technical debt piling up. But what if we break something? The tests might not catch everything. My gut says there's a deeper problem here, something we're not seeing. Maybe we should just ship it as-is and move on. No, that's not right. We need to do this properly, even if it takes longer. I remember the last time we rushed - it came back to haunt us. The architecture could be beautiful if we just took the time to think it through. But deadlines are breathing down our neck. Is this even worth it? We're just going in circles now.
