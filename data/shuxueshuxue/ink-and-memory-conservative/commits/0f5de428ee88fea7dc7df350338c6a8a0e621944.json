  "message": "Fix timing issue: force position recalc after StateChooser collapses\n\nPrevious fix wasn't enough - timing issue remained:\n1. selectedState changes\n2. commentGroups useMemo runs (wrong timing!)\n3. StateChooser's useEffect runs → collapses\n4. DOM updates but positions don't recalculate\n\nSolution: Add useEffect that triggers refsReady increment with 50ms delay\n- Ensures StateChooser has collapsed before recalculation\n- DOM has settled before measuring offsetTop\n- Console log added for debugging\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>",
