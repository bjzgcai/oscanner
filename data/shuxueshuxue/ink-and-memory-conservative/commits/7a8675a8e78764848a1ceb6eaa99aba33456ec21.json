  "message": "Integrate deck system into all voice-related features\n\nAll AI voice features now use deck system instead of old preferences:\n- Voice analysis (analyze_text): Uses load_voices_from_user_decks()\n- Writing suggestions (get_writing_suggestion): Random from enabled decks\n- Chat with voices (chat_with_voice): Looks up voice in enabled decks\n\nBenefits:\n- Users control which voices are active via Deck enable/disable toggles\n- Consistent voice source across all features\n- Cleaner architecture (deck system is single source of truth)\n\nChanges:\n- backend/server.py: Update all 3 session functions to use deck system\n- backend/database.py: load_voices_from_user_decks() returns enabled voices\n- frontend/src/components/DeckManager.tsx: Toggle UI integration\n- frontend/src/api/voiceApi.ts: API client for deck sync\n\nRelated: Auto-fork system, sync functionality already implemented",
