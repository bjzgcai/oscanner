  "message": "Fix auto-scroll issue with scroll preservation and textarea initialization\n\n- Preserve scroll position on state changes (not during typing)\n- Auto-size textareas on mount and when cells added/deleted\n- Remove conflicting useLayoutEffect that sized all textareas\n- Rely on existing targeted resize in handleTextChange for typing\n\nNote: Has effect ordering issue - scroll restoration runs before\ntextarea resize, will be fixed in next commit.",
