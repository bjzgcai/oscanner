-Ink & Memory is a Disco Elysium–inspired journaling environment where your inner voices respond to every sentence. The product has graduated from a quick concept to a multi-surface workspace with auto-save, calendar/timeline review, friend timelines, and per-user timezone awareness. We now treat English and Chinese as first-class citizens: voices, state prompts, and every UI label support both languages out of the box.

English and Chinese are first-class citizens: the editor, calendar, timeline, voices, and prompts work in both languages from the first keystroke.

-## ✨ Product Capabilities
+## ✨ Experience Highlights
 
 - **Living Commentary** — Thirteen Disco-style voices (Logic, Empathy, Volition, etc.) watch your text and deliver contextual comments, each with unique color/highlight styling.
 - **Dynamic Highlighting** — Trigger phrases are painted directly on the notebook, pairing each voice’s comment with the exact text that summoned it.
 - **Stateful Engine** — The backend remembers prior comments, prevents duplicates, enforces per-voice density, and honors the current emotional state/cube selection.
-- **English + Chinese Support** — The editor, calendar/timeline, and all voices can operate seamlessly in either language. Calendar titles, timeline captions, and first-line extraction work with both scripts.
-- **Auto-Save = Save** — Manual “Save today” and silent auto-save now share identical logic, guaranteeing every session writes `editor_state.createdAt`. Nothing gets lost, and the timeline/calendar stay synchronized.
-- **Calendar + Timeline Unification** — Both surfaces consume the same grouped session data, so captions/timezones always match. Clicking a day loads the exact session with full comments.

 - **Timezone-Aware Timeline** — Timestamps are stored in UTC but rendered in the viewer’s local timezone. We also capture each user’s preferred timezone to support future per-user scheduling.
 - **Friend Timelines** — Select friends to compare their daily pictures/comments side-by-side, with gentle hint cards when no friend data exists.
 - **Binder Aesthetic** — The UI is intentionally tactile with ring binders, Excalifont handwriting, and Xiaolai Chinese glyphs.

 All thirteen voices from Disco Elysium ship with the app: Logic, Empathy, Inland Empire, Volition, Drama, Authority, Half Light, Shivers, Composure, Encyclopedia, Conceptualization, Suggestion, and Electrochemistry.

-## 🎨 Design Philosophy
-
-### Vibe-Coding
-This project was built using "observe-code-observe-code" rapid iteration:
-- Minimal planning, maximal experimentation
-- See `backend/archive/vibe-coding-scraper-example/` for a documented example
-
-### Minimal Implementation
-- Simple is better than complex
-- Code buys features with complexity - spend wisely
-- `@@@` comments mark tricky parts for easy navigation

 ## 🗺️ Roadmap / TODO
 
 - **Per-user timeline scheduling** — Scheduler still triggers in a single timezone. Now that each user preference stores `timezone`, we need to update the cron job + DB helpers to run at each user’s local midnight.
