  "message": "Fix timing issue: wait for session save before reload\n\nRoot cause: Race condition in Start Fresh\n- window.location.reload() was OUTSIDE try block\n- Reload happened IMMEDIATELY, not waiting for saveSession\n- Result: Reloaded before new session saved → loaded old session\n\nFix: Move reload INSIDE try/catch blocks\n- Wait for await saveSession() to complete\n- Then reload → loads the newly saved empty session\n- Also reload in catch block to clear UI even if save fails\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>",
