  "message": "Restructure prompt to prevent LLM from extracting phrases from comments\n\nProblem: LLM was extracting phrases like \"adorning it with transcendence\"\nfrom existing comment text instead of from the user's original text,\ncausing 25 PHRASE_NOT_FOUND errors.\n\nSolution: Restructure prompt with clear visual sections:\n- \"TEXT TO ANALYZE\" - explicitly marked as phrase source\n- \"EXISTING CONVERSATION\" - full comments for context, but with warning\n- \"REJECTED PHRASES\" - explicit list of overlapped phrases\n- \"YOUR TASK\" - step-by-step instructions\n\nKey changes:\n- Added visual separators (════════) between sections\n- Multiple explicit warnings: \"Do NOT extract from conversation\"\n- Comments still visible for context (so agents see what others said)\n- Instructions repeatedly emphasize extraction from TEXT ONLY\n\nThis preserves conversational context while preventing confusion\nabout where to extract phrases from.\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>",
