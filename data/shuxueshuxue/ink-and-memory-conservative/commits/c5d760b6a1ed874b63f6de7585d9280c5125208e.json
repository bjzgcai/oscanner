  "message": "Fix critical Unicode normalization bug in phrase matching\n\nThe phrase matching was failing silently due to curly quote character\nmismatch. Editor uses curly apostrophes (U+2019) while backend returns\nstraight quotes (U+0027). Regex had corrupted characters (two straight\nquotes instead of curly quotes), causing normalization to be a no-op.\n\nKey changes:\n- Replace character literals with Unicode escapes in textNormalize.ts\n- Add debugLogger infrastructure for structured logging\n- Update energy threshold from 40 to 50\n- Integrate normalized matching across all phrase lookups\n- Add backend prompt rules to avoid highlighting quoted content\n- Clean up debug console.logs from VoiceSettings\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>",
