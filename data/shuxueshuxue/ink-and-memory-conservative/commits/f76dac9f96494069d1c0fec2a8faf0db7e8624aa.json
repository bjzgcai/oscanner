  "message": "Fix critical auth bugs: data loading and user profile\n\nFixes two critical issues after migration:\n\n1. **Data not loading after migration**:\n   - App now loads from database when authenticated\n   - Loads current/most recent session on mount\n   - Loads pictures from database (not localStorage)\n   - Loads user preferences (voice configs, selected state)\n   - Auto-saves to database every 3 seconds (authenticated users)\n   - Guest mode still uses localStorage\n\n2. **User profile button not working**:\n   - Added onClick handler to profile button\n   - Shows dropdown menu with user info and logout\n   - Displays first letter of name/email as avatar\n   - Clean dropdown UI with backdrop\n\nTechnical changes:\n- App.tsx: Load data from database on mount if authenticated\n- App.tsx: Auto-save to database with 3s debounce\n- App.tsx: Only save to localStorage in guest mode\n- CollectionsView.tsx: Load pictures from database\n- LeftSidebar.tsx: Add user menu dropdown with logout\n\nDatabase is now the source of truth for authenticated users!\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>",
