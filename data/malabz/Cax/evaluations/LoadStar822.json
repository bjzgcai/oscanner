      "reasoning": "LoadStar822 demonstrates strong open-source practices with clear versioning, detailed changelogs, and thoughtful refactoring (e.g., consolidating render module into ui). The project shows solid engineering leadership through incremental feature development and UI/UX improvements. However, there is minimal evidence of AI/ML work, cloud-native practices, or sophisticated testing infrastructure—this is a CLI/TUI tool for workflow orchestration rather than an AI-native system."
