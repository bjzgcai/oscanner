      "Backend and AI/ML development skills - all contributions are frontend-focused",

    "reasoning": "zhuchenyu2008 is primarily a frontend developer focused on UI improvements, mobile adaptation, and user experience features (energy bar visualization, button consistency). While showing good open-source collaboration through pull requests and documentation updates, there's no evidence of AI/ML, backend architecture, or cloud-native development. The contributor demonstrates solid frontend engineering practices but lacks breadth in full-stack AI development."
