      "Increase substantive code contributions with measurable changes",
      "Develop deeper technical implementations beyond configuration adjustments",

      "Take on more complex architectural or feature development tasks"
    ],
    "reasoning": "The contributor has made only 2 commits with zero net code changes (+0 -0), indicating minimal technical contribution. While 'Refactor model role config' suggests AI-related work and awareness of configuration management, the lack of actual code changes makes it impossible to assess depth of technical capability. The commits appear to be minor fixes or configuration adjustments rather than substantive feature development or architectural improvements."
