      "Direct code contribution rather than primarily merging others' work",
      "Technical depth in AI/ML and backend architecture"
    ],
    "reasoning": "F2J primarily acts as a maintainer/reviewer, merging 5 PRs from contributor 'zhuchenyu2008' covering frontend improvements (mobile adaptation, energy visualization, UI controls) and documentation updates. While demonstrating good open-source stewardship and project management, there's limited evidence of direct technical contribution to AI/ML features, architecture design, or infrastructure. The role appears more focused on integration and quality control than hands-on development."
