    "reasoning": "zhuchenyu2008 focuses primarily on frontend UI improvements, particularly mobile adaptation and visual features (energy bar, animations, responsive layouts). The work shows good attention to UX details but lacks depth in AI/ML, architecture, or infrastructure. Multiple commits deleting and re-adding the same file (App.tsx) indicate workflow or version control challenges. Contributions are mostly isolated frontend changes rather than cross-functional or architectural improvements."
